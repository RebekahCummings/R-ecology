### Using an Rmd file, create a short analysis report of the  dataset.

Feel free to collaborate!


1. Write an Rmd script to load the Portal data file and make a box plot of
   weight by sex for male and female animals. Make sure you load any packages
   (dplyr, etc.) that you may need to create this. Describe the results,
   including the mean of each group, using markdown text.
2. Make a histogram of hindfoot length.
2. Choose three species. Make a scatterplot of weight vs hindfoot length, with
   the points colored by species id.
3. For the species code `DM`, use dplyr to calculate the total number of counts
   per year for each plot type.
4. Using the data frame you just created, plot the counts over time as line
   graphs faceted by plot type.
